# 📝 Java To-Do List Console App

This is a beginner-friendly **To-Do List application** built in Java. It allows users to:

- ✅ Add tasks  
- 📋 View all tasks  
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed  
- 🔍 Search tasks by keyword  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks

Each task is stored with a simple status (done / not done), and the menu is decorated with emojis for clarity and fun!

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app uses a `Task` class to represent each task with:
- A description
- A status flag for completion

All tasks are stored in an `ArrayList<Task>`. The program runs in a loop allowing users to interact with the list using numbers to choose actions.
